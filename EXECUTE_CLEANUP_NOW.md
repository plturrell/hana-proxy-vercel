# 🚨 EXECUTE A2A REGISTRY CLEANUP NOW

## Quick Execution Steps

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fnsbxaywhsxqppncqksu/sql/new

2. **Copy and paste the entire SQL script from `cleanup.sql`**

3. **Click "Run" to execute**

## What This Will Do:

✅ **Creates a backup** of the current registry (85+ agents)  
✅ **Removes all functions** from the A2A registry (~76 entries)  
✅ **Preserves exactly 9 true autonomous agents**  
✅ **Verifies the cleanup** was successful  

## The 9 Agents That Will Remain:

1. `finsight.analytics.regime_detection` - Market regime detection
2. `finsight.analytics.portfolio_rebalancing` - Portfolio rebalancing
3. `finsight.analytics.risk_budgeting` - Risk budget allocation
4. `finsight.analytics.risk_parity` - Risk parity optimization
5. `finsight.analytics.copula_modeling` - Dependency modeling
6. `finsight.analytics.garch_volatility` - Volatility forecasting
7. `finsight.analytics.stress_testing` - Stress scenario testing
8. `finsight.analytics.performance_attribution` - Performance analysis
9. `finsight.analytics.portfolio_optimization` - Portfolio optimization

## Expected Results:

- **Before**: ~85 entries (mix of agents and functions)
- **After**: 9 entries (only true autonomous agents)
- **Functions**: Still accessible via ORD/function registry

## Safety:

- Full backup is created before any deletions
- Only non-agent entries are removed
- All 9 true agents are explicitly preserved

## Ready to Execute!

The SQL script in `cleanup.sql` is ready for immediate execution.
